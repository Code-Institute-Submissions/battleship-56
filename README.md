## Credits 
Came across this when been going through and looking for a start to the game, found this! 
which i've borrowed more or less everything from in my code from this, why? it's been a very interesting jurney through this code. 
i've just finished of the python module,and been lagging behind since day one.
and this one i could understand it from the get go, very much like what's been present in the course, and easy to read. needed some tlc, which i've hope i have givving it, in the short time i've had to get this done.<br>


SO BIGGEST CREDIT GOES TO THIS GITHUB SOURCE: ( MAIN SOURCE FOR MY CODE !!!!!!!!! )

- Let's make "VERY CLEAR!" that without this code start above, and videos would never maid it this far!
