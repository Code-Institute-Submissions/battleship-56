## Credits 
Came across this when been going through and looking for a start to the game, found this! 
which I've borrowed more or less everything from in my code from this, why? it's been a very interesting journey through this code. 
I've just finished the Python module, and have been behind since day one.

And this one I could understand it from the get-go, very much like what's been present in the course, and easy to read. needed some TLC,
 which I've hope I have given it, in the short time i had to get this done.


SO THE BIGGEST CREDIT GOES TO THIS GITHUB SOURCE: ( MAIN SOURCE FOR MY CODE !!!!!!!!! )

- Let's make it "VERY CLEAR!" that without this code starting above, 
and videos would never made it this far! 


Found some small things in here.
